I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Experimental Linguistics at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, working within the  [Centre for Language Evolution Studies](https://cles.umk.pl/). My research explores the nature and origins of linguistic iconicity, the multimodality of human communication, and questions about language evolution through experimental and cross-linguistic methods.

Previously, I was a Principal Investigator and PostDoc at the Research Area 1: [Laboratory Phonology](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/research/research-areas/laboratory-phonology), [Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/) in Berlin, where I worked on gesture-speech coordination and multimodal phonetic phenomena (project ["On the FLExibility and Stability of Gesture-speecH Coordination (FLESH): Evidence from Production, Comprehension, and Imitation"](https://www.flesh-vicom.de/)). I completed my Ph.D. in General Linguistics at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2022, focusing on [iconicity in language and speech](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/25687).

Why some people call me Ola [ɔla]
======
I come from Poland, and in Poland, the short version of the name Aleksandra is <i>Ola</i>. I don't know why, but I like to consider the Polish vowel system when thinking about this. You see, we only have six vowels in Polish: [a ɛ i ɨ u ɔ], written as &lt;a e i y u o&gt;. Alicja is <i>Ala</i>, Elżbieta is <i>Ela</i>, Urszula is <i>Ula</i>... Ask any Polish native speaker and they will most likely tell you that <i>Ila</i> and <i>Yla</i> feel weird. So, <b>Ola</b> it was. That's how the convention was made.

Mateusz Adamczyk comes with a [scientific explanation](https://www.tiktok.com/@.mateuszadamczyk/video/7198530480629697797?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7376583711061689888) (also see [this post](https://sjp.pwn.pl/poradnia/haslo/dlaczego-Ola;12479.html)). At some point, through language contact with Ukrainian and Russian, Oleksandra emerged as a version of Aleksandra. Later, Oleksandra disappeared from Polish, and the short form of the name, i.e., Ola, was attached to the remaining original Aleksandra.
