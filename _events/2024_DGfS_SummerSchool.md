I will be giving a week-long seminar on the Iconicity in Communication during the DGfS 2024 Summer School.

This course explores iconicity in communication across various modalities. Departing from a theoretical foundation in semiotics and related fields, we will examine the manifestations of iconicity in spoken and sign languages, gestures, and prosody, as well as its impact on language acquisition, processing, and evolution. The course will address the contentious relationship between iconicity and the principle of arbitrariness in linguistic signs, challenging traditional views with evidence that supports the significant and widespread nature of iconicity in language. Participants will engage in interactive sessions and learn to empirically explore iconicity in the communication that surrounds them.
