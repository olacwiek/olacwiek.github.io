I led the tutorium to the seminar <i>Introduction to Linguistics DaF</i> by Dr. Susanne Horstmann.

Course description (based on Bielefeld University's ekvv):<br>
In this seminar, we will look at language and its description. Various aspects relevant to your future professional practice will be discussed, e.g.

* What units does human language consist of and how are they put together so that people can communicate with each other?
* How does communication work? And what exactly is the "communicative competence" that should be taught in foreign language lessons?
* How can pronunciation be corrected? And what knowledge do you need to be able to do this?
* How do people learn to write? And what is different in literacy courses than in other language courses?
* What is good vocabulary work in GFL and GIZ lessons? And what principles should be taken into account?
* How should grammar work be implemented in the classroom? And what do teachers need to know about words and sentences in order to carry out good grammar work? To what extent does knowledge about language help to correct mistakes?
* What actually is a text? And what makes a good text? How can learners be helped to write good texts?

Starting with German, we will also look at other languages in order to demonstrate the benefits of linguistics for teaching and learning German as a second/foreign language and other second/foreign languages.
The work in the seminar is supported by preparatory reading of texts and exercises. A (voluntary) tutorium is offered for the seminar.
