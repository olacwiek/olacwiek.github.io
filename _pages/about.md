I'm a Principal Investigator and a PostDoc at the Research Area 1: [Laboratory Phonology](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/en/research/research-areas/laboratory-phonology), [Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics](https://www.leibniz-zas.de/) in Berlin. Currently, I'm co-leading a project ["On the FLExibility and Stability of Gesture-speecH Coordination (FLESH): Evidence from Production, Comprehension, and Imitation"](https://vicom.info/projects/on-the-flexibility-and-stability-of-gesture-speech-coordination-flesh-evidence-from-production-comprehension-and-imitation/), funded within the DFG Priority Programme [Visual Communication](https://vicom.info/). This project is a collaboration with Susanne Fuchs, Wim Pouw, and Šárka Kadavá.

I'm a phonetician by training and passion. My research primarily focuses on exploring iconicity in language across various levels, with a special emphasis on spoken language. This research spans acoustic and prosodic aspects, as well as sound symbolism. Additionally, I delve into the kinematic properties and multimodality of communication.

I completed my Ph.D. in General Linguistics at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2022. My thesis ["Iconicity in Language and Speech"](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/25687) was supervised by Manfred Krifka, Susanne Fuchs, and Marcus Perlman.

I'm one of the initiators of the [envisionBOX](https://envisionbox.org/), a platform for learners and creators working with multimodal data.


Why some people call me Ola [ɔla]
======
I come from Poland, and in Poland, the short version of the name Aleksandra is <i>Ola</i>. I don't know why, but I like to consider the Polish vowel system when thinking about this. You see, we only have six vowels in Polish: [a ɛ i ɨ u ɔ], written as &lt;a e i y u o&gt;. Alicja is <i>Ala</i>, Elżbieta is <i>Ela</i>, Urszula is <i>Ula</i>... Ask any Polish native speaker and they will most likely tell you that <i>Ila</i> and <i>Yla</i> feel weird. So, <b>Ola</b> it was. That's how the convention was made.

Mateusz Adamczyk comes with a [scientific explanation](https://www.tiktok.com/@.mateuszadamczyk/video/7198530480629697797?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7376583711061689888) (also see [this post](https://sjp.pwn.pl/poradnia/haslo/dlaczego-Ola;12479.html)). At some point, through language contact with Ukrainian and Russian, Oleksandra emerged as a version of Aleksandra. Later, Oleksandra disappeared from Polish, and the short form of the name, i.e., Ola, was attached to the remaining original Aleksandra.
