I led the tutorium to the lecture <i>Phonetics and Phonology</i> by Prof. Dr. Petra Wagner.

Course description (based on Bielefeld University's ekvv):<br>
Phonetics and phonology are concerned with the description and modeling of spoken language phenomena and their linguistic function. For this purpose, it is necessary to deal with the perception (perceptive phonetics), production (pronunciation, articulatory phonetics) as well as acoustic manifestations (acoustic phonetics) and symbolic notation (descriptive phonetics/symbolic phonetics) of sounds. In addition to an introduction to the central sub-areas of phonetics, there will be a basic introduction to the linguistic functional level of phonetic phenomena, i.e. phonology or functional phonetics. Various phonological descriptive formalisms and theories will be introduced. As a supplement to the lecture, a voluntary tutorial is offered in which the teaching content is deepened by means of practical exercises.

The lecture includes the following contents:<br>
Descriptive phonetics/symbolic phonetics
Acoustic phonetics
Articulatory phonetics
Perceptive phonetics
Prosody
Phonological processes
Phonotactics
Distinctive features
Generative phonology (linear and "non-linear")
Optimality theory
