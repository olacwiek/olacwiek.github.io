Course description:<br>
The course introduces students to the subject areas, questions and methods of linguistics. The focus is on the various levels of grammatical structure formation - phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and the related sub-areas of phonetics, graphemics and pragmatics. Basic linguistic terms and concepts will be explained using traditional and modern methods of analysis based on the example of German and their interaction will be described. The approach will be characterized by a view of the cognitive foundations of language and the typological classification of German in the spectrum of the world's languages.

Full assessment available upon request.

The course is taught with Ludger Paschen.
