Ebert, M. & <b>Ćwiek, A.</b> (07.2023). <i>Does thin sound “small” and heavy sound “big”? – An investigation of the size sound symbolic potential of antonym adjective pairs</i>.

This work was first-authored by the Melissa Ebert, an MA student from my course on sound symbolism in the summer semester 2022 at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
